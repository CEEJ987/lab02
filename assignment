# Class 2 Notes

The topic for this module help us learn about how to navigate through our computer more fluently. Kind of like taking back roads, slightly faster and more accessible.
For example such as, creating files, moving them, and removing them.
It also  allows you increase the speed of the process of opening programs & making automations.

## [Lab 2 Assignment]()

### The Command Line

The Terminal is a text based interface that allows you to produce code to the computer.
Basically, a simple form of an text editor
Adding, Deleting, and Moving Directories

You start by entering commands like ls and using a command argument to specify
The first command line argument is called an option
An option modifies the behavior of a command
(Usually starts with a -)

## Bash

Within the terminal is a shell, which defines how your terminal behaves
**Bash** is the most popular (Mac comes with zsch)

## Navigating

**pwd** - prints current directory
**ls** - tells whats in the current directory
(ls can be used more powerfully)
***ls (options) (location)***

A ***path*** is the means to get to a particular directory or file

The Two different types of Paths : ***Absolute*** and ***Relative***

- A ***Relative Path*** is the location of a file relative to its current directory
- A ***Absolute Path*** describes the locaiton from the root directory

### Some Navigation Commands
**~** is used as a shortcut to your home directory
**.** is used to reference your current directory
**..** is used to to reference the parent directory
(.. can be used to keep returning to the root directory)

**cd** allows you to move in directories
(Tip: Pressing Tab while typing a command can auto complete it for you!)

## Information about Files

Extensions are what comes after file names, for most OS, its important (When using programming language)
Linux looks inside the file 

**file** is a command to use to find out what type of file it may be. 

Linux is **CASE** sensitive

Spaces in names can be found if using certain methods:
1. Quoting ('')
2. Escape characters (\)
(If a file starts with a ., it means its a hidden file)

## Things I'm curious to know more about

I want to find out more about the opening program side of command lines & how to organize files more efficiently.
